# What is OtterPlayer ï¼Ÿ
- **OtterPlayer** is an web base video player for **local video file**
- `Offline supported`
- `PWA Installable (chrome)`.

# Why OtterPlayer 
  Why? As a **MacBook** user, I heavily relay on **finger zoom in** feature when watch tech video. It's annoying me that any macOS video player App can not **finger zoom in**, So I creat **OtterPlayer** for myself to watch local file.
