# What is, Why OtterPlayer ï¼Ÿ
  **OtterPlayer** is a local file video player, Web App (PWA) power by [video.js](https://github.com/videojs/video.js) and [preactjs](https://github.com/preactjs/preact). OtterPlayer working `offline` and `installable (chrome)`.  

  Why? As a **MacBook** user, I heavily relay on **finger zoom in** feature when watch tech video. It's  annoying me than macOS video player App can not **finger zoom in**, So I creat **OtterPlayer** for myself.
